“Dad will be back within a day or two,” said Andy, “and I’ll be mighty glad to turn the responsibility of this whole affair over to him. When he’s back on the job, we’ll take a whirl at finding this unknown agent of the Rubanian Gerka who is to destroy the Goliath,” he told Bert. Timms was busy with a long-distance call to the department of justice in Washington, informing his chief there of the latest development at Bellevue. When he finished, he turned to talk with Andy and Bert. “Half a dozen army pursuit planes, fully equipped for combat, will drop down here tomorrow morning,” he said. “They’ll remain until the Goliath is ready to take the air and after that at least two of them will accompany the big ship on all of its trial flights. In addition, an
anti-aircraft battery with complete night lighting equipment will arrive before sundown tomorrow.”
